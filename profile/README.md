### our philosophy

_**to try to solve challenges with societal impact by merging state-of-the-art 
artificial intelligence, chemical sciences & engineering, and automation**_.

>the Gomes group is broadly interested in the development of novel
reactions, catalysis and materials. we seek to solve these problems by combining
state-of-the-art machine learning, computational chemistry, and experimental automation. 
our hope is a revolution in how chemistry is asked, explored and answered.

### who we are

chemists, engineers, mathematicians, software developers, roboticists, physicists. in general, just very curious people
from all over the world trying to tackle problems that can help us all live healthier and more prosperous lives.
